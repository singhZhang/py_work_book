The baby eagle was hungry. "I'm sure to die," said the baby eagle, all the time.
 
"Very soon, death is coming," he cried, with tears streaming down his face. Over and over. But there was no one there to hear him.
 
Then one day the mother eagle appeared at the top of the mountain cliff, with a big bowl of delicious food and she looked down at her baby. The baby looked up at the mother and cried "Why did you abandon me? I'm going to die any minute. How could you do this to me?"
 
The mother said, "Here is some very tasty and nourishing food, all you have to do is come get it."
 
"Come get it!" said the baby, with much anger. "How?"
 
The mother flew away.
 
The baby cried and cried and cried.
 
A few days later, "I'm going to end it all," he said. "I give up. It is time for me to die."
 
He didn't know his mother was nearby. She swooped5 down to the nest with his last meal.
 
"Eat this, it's your last meal," she said.
 
The baby cried, but he ate and whined6 and whined about what a bad mother she was.
 
"You're a terrible mother," he said. Then she pushed him out of the nest.
